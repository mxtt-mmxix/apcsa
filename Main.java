     * Date: 3/2/21 Aim: How can we use Sequential/Linear searches with arrays and
     * ArrayLists in a Java program?
     * 
     * Do Now: Read the following.
     * 
     * Sequential or linear search is the only method that can be used to find a
     * value in unsorted data. It usually starts at the first element and walks
     * through the array or list until it finds the value it is looking for and
     * returns the index it found it at, or it loops until the end of the array or
     * list and then it returns a -1 to show that it didnâ€™t find the value in the
     * array or list.
     * 
     * Binary searches can only be used when the data set is sorted.
     */

     * double/Double values a threshold, delta must be used to determine if the
     * value is found and valid. To determine if a value is within the exceptable
     * range: find the difference between the absolute value of the magicNumber and
     * the Double at a specific index. i.e. delta = 0.01, if magicNumber is 3.45 and
